# 🐍 100 Days of Python

Welcome to my 100 Days of Python challenge!

Starting Date: June 2, 2025
Ending Date: N/A
Currently on Day: 13 (Skipped 7-12 Due to NVIDIA Workshop)
## 📚 Origin

This challenge is based on the [100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. It's an intensive and beginner-to-advanced course that dives into Python fundamentals, projects, and concepts including web development, game development, data science, and automation.

## 🎯 Why I'm Doing This

I'm taking on this challenge as part of my journey to become a **Data Engineer** and to **master Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. 

Through this, I aim to:

- Strengthen my Python foundations
- Build real-world projects daily
- Improve my problem-solving and code structuring skills
- Prepare for more advanced topics in data engineering, including data pipelines and cloud integrations

## 🚀 Progress Tracker

You can follow my daily progress here as I complete each project and commit what I’ve learned. I'm documenting each day’s work in separate folders with notes and code for easy reference.
